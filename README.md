# Pronoun-game

##  Teach a Child Pronunciation while Learning about Environmental Threads

Alexa skill designed during the [INTERSPEECH Hackaton 2019](https://interspeech2019.org/students/student_events/), where we got joint to [@TAriasVergara](https://github.com/TAriasVergara) the first price of the jury panel.


## Motivation

We developed a serious game designed for a primary purpose other than pure entertainment. The main aim of pronoun game is to create awareness about the environment while it provides unobtrusive pronunciation training. Pronoun game can be used for second language learning and for speech therapy applications with children. The main challenge is to make the game expandable by teachers/therapists without technical skills. Our skill has a list of endangered animals with correct and incorrect pronunciations of the name of the species. The child guesses an animal based on questions asked by Alexa. There are three possible answers: (1) incorrect guess. For this case Alexa provides additional hints about the animal. (2) Correct guess with a correct pronunciation. Here, Alexa provides information about the endangered species. (3) Correct guess with incorrect pronunciation. Alexa casually corrects the child and provides information about endangered species.
